Students at Codam start with the LIBFT project, where they are required to write their own library functions.
Codam allows almost no in-built functions to be used, with a couple exceptions (write(), malloc() and free()).

Students are encouraged to continually add to this library, updating it as needed.

The required functions can be found in the PDF.
